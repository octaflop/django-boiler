DJANGO BOILER is boilerplate code for deploying a django project with nginx.  It
combines an ngninx conf template script I wrote for some projects in summer
2011. They are now polished up for your gawking pleasure.

A lot of the settings tricks are borrowed from django-fiber. Riding that pony!
Indeed this is the way that I will make most of my deployments from now on.

The templates are based on HTML5 Boilerplate (http://html5boilerplate.com/) and
the nginx config is based on the updates with HTML5 boilerplate v2.
